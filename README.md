Higher-order organization of complex networks
--------

This is experimental Matlab code for the methods and some of the examples in

Higher-order Organization of Complex Networks.
Austin R. Benson, David F. Gleich, and Jure Leskovec.
Science, vol. 353, no. 6295, pp. 163-166, 2016.

If you use this code in a publication, please cite the paper.

There is also [C++](http://snap.stanford.edu/higher-order/) and
[Julia](https://github.com/arbenson/higher-order-organization-julia) code.

See the [project page](http://snap.stanford.edu/higher-order/) for more
information about the methods.

Dependencies
--------
* [MatlabBGL](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/dgleich/packages/matlab_bgl/) for graph processing in Matlab.
  This is needed to run the examples, but is not necessary to use the rest of the code.

Examples
--------
* `celegans_example.m` reproduces some of the results in Figure 2 of the paper.
* `foodweb_example.m` reproduces some of the results in Section S7.1 of the paper.
